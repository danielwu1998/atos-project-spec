# Atos Cloud Native Project – Overview 
 
## Introduction 
 
The purpose of this document is to outline the project specification to be completed during the next 4 weeks with QA Consulting. The deadline for this project is 30th November 2020. 
 
It is designed to give you an opportunity to work with and display your knowledge of the following technologies: 
 
Software Development: 
- Project Management 
- Databases 
- Java SE 
- Spring Boot 
- Front-End Development

DevOps: 
- Continuous Integration 
- Cloud Fundamentals 
- Cloud Providers 
- Automated Testing 
 
## Overview 
 
This is a group project. As a result, this project is designed in part to test your ability to organise yourself in a team setting and delegate work effectively. 
 
You are expected to follow an Agile approach to your project management, requiring you to organise your project into Sprints, assign scrum roles and produce a product backlog in the form of a Kanban board. 
 
You are expected to fully develop an application based on a specification that has been provided for you. The application is for use as a teaching aid tool. 
 
In addition, you are expected to produce a basic CI pipeline to integrate and deploy new code as it is created. 
 
You will have 4 weeks to deliver this project. At the end of these four weeks, your entire team is responsible for presenting your completed application and pipeline to the stakeholders. 
 
## Application Specification 
 
The application you are tasked to develop is a Spring Boot Help Queue application with full CRUD functionality for practical use as a teaching aid. 
 
The concept is a web-hosted application that learners can access to post help tickets to a publicly accessible help queue. 
 
Teachers can then use this queue to recognise who has asked for help and who has been waiting the longest. When a leaner has received the help they need, they can mark the ticket as "Done". 
 
The full specification is detailed in the Technical Specification document provided with this project outline. 
 
Described in this specification is the basic functionality of the application plus a list of proposed features. You are expected to implement and demonstrate the basic functionality plus at least 2 additional features from this list. 
 
## CI/CD Pipeline 
 
Code must be fully integrated into a Version Control System using the Feature-Branch model which will subsequently be built and tested through a Continuous Integration (CI) server, and finally deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine, making it accessible via the internet. 
  
To achieve this, you will make use of the following technologies: 
- Version Control System (VCS): Git 
- Cloud Provider: GCP 
- CI Server: Jenkins 
 
## Constraints 
 
The time constraint for this project is 4 weeks. You must plan the work around this time constraint. 
You must plan your project utilising Agile Scrum methodology. This should include: 
- Assigning a Scrum Master 
- Creating a Product Backlog 
- Creating a Kanban Board 
- Creating User Stories 
- Organising work into Sprints and holding Sprint Retrospectives 
 
## Software Development 
 
The overall constraint for the application is the project brief. The application functionality and additional features should follow those set out in the brief, with features being demonstrated as part of the final presentation. 
- Coding Language: Java 
- API Framework: Spring Boot 
- UI: JS, HTML AND CSS 
- Full CRUD functionality 
- Microservice architecture 
 
## Deliverables 
 
The final deliverable for this project is as follows: 
- A fully functioning Help Queue web application deployed in an GCP virtual machine 
- Full documentation of the system, including project development, risk assessment, component level diagrams and installation instructions 
- A simple automated CI system, also with full documentation discussing how the tools were utilised 
- A 30 minute presentation that demonstrates: 
    - your team's project management approach (team roles, sprints, product backlog, priorities, etc.) 
    - the functioning application and the features that were implemented 
    - the functioning CI pipeline with a fully automated rolling update 
 
Documentation should include full system and component level diagrams, discussion of all the tools utilised and installation instructions to both run the application and set up the CI pipeline.
